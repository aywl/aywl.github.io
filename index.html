    Welcome to my page!

  <p>
    My name is Andy Lam. I graduated from UBC with a B.Sc. majoring in Biochemistry. During the completion of my degree I took CPSC 301: Computing for life sciences, where I was introduced to programming using Python 3. I found that I really enjoyed coding. Now I just started learning html and css, so I made this little site. It will surely improve as my skills develop. I hope you find this site fun to read!
