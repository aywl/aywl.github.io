    My name is Andy Lam. I graduated from <a href="http://www.ubc.ca/about/">UBC</a> with a B.Sc. majoring in Biochemistry. During the completion of my degree I took CPSC 301: Computing for life sciences, where I was introduced to programming using Python 3. I found that I really enjoyed coding. Now I just started learning html and css, so I made this little site. It will surely improve as my skills develop. I hope you find this site fun to read!

    For now the site is entirely in HTML so it looks really basic, but once I get confortable with CSS I'll come back with a really nice-looking site! May 31st 2017.
